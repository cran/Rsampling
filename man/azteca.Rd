\description{
Number of \emph{Azteca} ants recruited by leaf extracts of
their host plant , \emph{Cecropia} trees.
}
\section{Details}{

The ant colonies live in the hollow
trunk of \emph{Cecropia} and can detect and expel leaf-chewing insects.
To test if this response is more intense in young leaves, drops of extract of smashed young and old leaves
were poured in two neighbor leaves of the same plant. After 7 minutes the number of recruited ants in each leaf was recorded.
